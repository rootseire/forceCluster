# forceCluster
A D3js Website Navigation Menu

This visualisation is built off of the D3 Cluster Force Layout by Mike Bostock https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7881887

It is modified to do a number of custom requirements, including:

1) the wrapping of text onto a new line when it reaches the outer area of the circle
2) a bounding box that contrains the visualisation from moving out of the surrounding DIV tag

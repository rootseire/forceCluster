# forceCluster

<h1>Development</h1>

A D3js Website Navigation Menu - live example here: http://rootseire.github.io/forceCluster

This visualisation is built off of the D3 Cluster Force Layout by Mike Bostock https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7881887

It is modified to do a number of custom requirements, including:

1) the wrapping of text onto a new line when it reaches the outer area of the circle
2) a bounding box that contrains the visualisation from moving out of the surrounding DIV tag

<h1>Limitations</h1>
This visualisation was built under some time constraints, and compromises were made as a result. One of the developments I would have liked to make would have been to ensure that circles do not get pulled into neighbouring clusters. Overall, the visualisation works 99% as expected.
